# Security Considerations for SPY Protocol

## Threat Model

SPY Protocol assumes the following threat environment:

### Attackers Can:
- Intercept all network traffic
- Replay captured messages
- Attempt brute force attacks
- Launch denial of service attacks
- Compromise individual agents or proxies

### Attackers Cannot:
- Break ECDSA cryptography
- Access properly secured private keys
- Forge signatures without private keys
- Predict cryptographic random numbers

## Security Properties

### Authentication
- **Mutual Authentication**: Both agent and proxy prove their identities
- **Non-repudiation**: Signed messages provide proof of origin
- **Key-based Identity**: No passwords to phish or steal

### Confidentiality
- SPY Protocol does NOT provide encryption of data
- Use TLS for transport security
- Session tokens should be treated as sensitive

### Integrity
- All authentication messages are signed
- Modification of messages will cause authentication failure
- Use message authentication codes for session data

## Known Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

### 1. Replay Attacks
**Threat**: Attacker replays captured authentication messages

**Mitigations**:
- Challenges are single-use with 60-second expiry
- Timestamps validated within ±5 minutes
- Session-specific nonces prevent cross-session replay

### 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
**Threat**: Attacker intercepts and modifies messages

**Mitigations**:
- All messages cryptographically signed
- Public key exchange in initial handshake
- Certificate pinning for known proxies (RECOMMENDED)
- Use TLS for transport (REQUIRED)

### 3. Denial of Service
**Threat**: Attacker floods proxy with authentication attempts

**Mitigations**:
- Rate limiting per IP address (10 attempts/minute)
- Exponential backoff on failures
- Challenge computation should be cheap
- Signature verification before expensive operations

### 4. Key Compromise
**Threat**: Agent's private key is stolen

**Mitigations**:
- Hardware security modules for key storage
- Key rotation policies
- Revocation mechanisms
- Session limits even with valid keys

### 5. Time-based Attacks
**Threat**: Clock manipulation to replay old messages

**Mitigations**:
- NTP synchronization (RECOMMENDED)
- ±5 minute timestamp tolerance
- Monotonic session counters for heartbeats

### 6. Session Hijacking
**Threat**: Attacker steals session token

**Mitigations**:
- Tokens bound to connection characteristics
- Regular heartbeat verification
- Automatic session expiry
- Token rotation for long sessions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Secure Key Storage
- Use operating system key stores
- Hardware security modules for high-value keys
- Never log or transmit private keys
- Encrypted storage at rest

### Random Number Generation
- Use `/dev/urandom` or equivalent
- Never use predictable seeds
- Minimum 128 bits of entropy
- Separate generators for different purposes

### Timing Attack Prevention
- Constant-time signature verification
- Fixed-time challenge validation
- Avoid early returns in crypto operations

### Audit and Logging
- Log all authentication attempts
- Record failure reasons
- Monitor for attack patterns
- Never log sensitive key material

## Security Checklist for Implementers

### Agent Implementation
- [ ] Private keys stored securely
- [ ] Validate proxy certificates
- [ ] Check message timestamps
- [ ] Verify challenge freshness
- [ ] Clear session tokens on logout

### Proxy Implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Challenge expiry enforced
- [ ] Signature verification correct
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

### Deployment
- [ ] TLS properly configured
- [ ] Time synchronization working
- [ ] Key rotation scheduled
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## Cryptographic Agility

SPY Protocol is designed for algorithm migration:

### Current (v1.0)
- ECDSA with P-256/P-384
- SHA-256/SHA-384 hashing

### Future Considerations
- Post-quantum algorithms (when standardized)
- EdDSA as alternative
- SHA-3 family adoption

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. DO NOT open a public issue
2. Email security@[domain] with details
3. Include reproduction steps if possible
4. Allow time for patch before disclosure

## Security Updates

Monitor these sources for security updates:
- GitHub security advisories
- Version release notes
- Implementation security bulletins

## Compliance Notes

SPY Protocol implementations may need to comply with:
- GDPR (key material as personal data)
- PCI DSS (if protecting payment systems)
- HIPAA (if protecting health data)
- Regional cryptography regulations

Consult legal counsel for specific requirements.
